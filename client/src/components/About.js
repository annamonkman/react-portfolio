                <p>I am a creative and perceptive junior web developer with a background in the Visual Arts who has recently completed a Software Engineering Bootcamp at General Assembly.</p>
                <p>I graduated from a BA Fine Art Degree with First Class Honours in 2019. During my studies I specialised in using digital filmmaking and animation software. I enjoy the process of developing a visual and conceptual outcome using aesthetic decision-making, technical skills and problem solving.  Learning to code was top of my list of skills to develop after graduating, as it is a skill that enables many avenues for creation and innovation.</p>
                <p>Additionally I have a long term fascination with the internet from a social and cultural point of view and am excited to be a part of its evolution.</p>
                <p>Having greatly enjoyed the learning and collaborative aspects of the Software Engineering Bootcamp at General Assembly, I am excited to enter the world of tech on a professional level. I hope to continue to learn and be challenged as well as bring my creativity and eye for detail to any team I join.</p>
